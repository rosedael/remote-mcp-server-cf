# COMPLiQ MCP Server Implementation Approach

This document outlines the approach for implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for COMPLiQ using Cloudflare Workers.

## Overview

We've customized a Cloudflare MCP server template to serve as a bridge between AI assistants and the COMPLiQ platform. The server provides MCP tools corresponding to each of the four primary steps in the COMPLiQ API workflow.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Core MCP Server Structure

We're using the Cloudflare MCP server template as our foundation, maintaining the essential structure:
- `MyMCP` class that extends `McpAgent`
- Server configuration with name and version
- Tool definitions within the `init()` method
- Request handling for SSE and MCP endpoints

### 2. Tool Implementation

Each COMPLiQ API endpoint is mapped to a corresponding MCP tool:

1. **inputPrompt** - (Mandatory) Submits a user's prompt to COMPLiQ
2. **addFile** - (Optional) Attaches a file to a request
3. **intermediateResults** - (Optional) Sends intermediate processing results
4. **processingResult** - (Mandatory) Submits the final answer

Each tool:
- Defines parameters using Zod schemas
- Converts parameters to multipart/form-data format
- Makes POST requests to the appropriate COMPLiQ API endpoint
- Handles errors and returns responses in the MCP format

### 3. File Handling

For tools that accept files, we:
- Accept base64-encoded file data through the MCP interface
- Convert the base64 data to a binary Blob
- Attach the file to the FormData object with the appropriate filename and content type
- Enforce file format restrictions as specified in the COMPLiQ API

### 4. Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:
- Try/catch blocks around all API requests
- Proper error message formatting for MCP clients
- Validation of required parameters before sending requests

### 5. Authentication

API authentication is handled via:
- x-api-key headers for each request
- Environment variable for the COMPLiQ API key
- Configuration in wrangler.jsonc with empty placeholder for security

## Deployment Workflow

1. Configure API key in wrangler.jsonc or as a secret
2. Deploy the worker to Cloudflare
3. Connect an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) using the mcp-remote proxy

## Potential Extensions

Future enhancements could include:
- Better response formatting for improved readability in the MCP client
- Adding prompts to help AI assistants understand the COMPLiQ workflow
- Adding resources that describe the COMPLiQ platform and its capabilities
- Implementing OAuth for user authentication if needed in the future
